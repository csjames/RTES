libsodium lives at https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium. It's licence is in ./from-libsodium.

To build the embedded stuff you might have to change the CC_ARM and CFLAGS_EMBED variables in the Makefile.

What all the directories are:
./from-libsodium -  Stripped down version of libsodium to just do signing.
./hosted - Stuff that can only be run in a hosted environment
./hosted/from-libsodium - Stuff from libsodium for generating keypairs. We cannot do this on embedded hardware because we need stong random numbers
